# Water-Level-Indication-and-Controlling-using-8051-microcontroller
Water Level Controller using 8051 Microcontroller project will help in automatically controlling the water motor by sensing the water level in a tank. This system monitors the water level of the tank and automatically switches ON the motor whenever tank is empty. The motor is switched OFF when the overhead tank or container is FULL.
